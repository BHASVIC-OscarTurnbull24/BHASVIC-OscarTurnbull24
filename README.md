## About me
My name is Oscar Turnbull and I am a year 12 college student at BHASVIC studying Computer Science, Mathematics and Futher Mathematics at A level. I am strongly interested in programming and computer science and I aim to create applicable computer systems which benefit the lives of its users.

# Professional goals
I aim to study a degree in Computer Science at university and will be applying to Oxford Univeristy for their Computer Science course. This will allow me to understand the forefront of computer science theory and experiment with practical programming and system design so that I am best prepared for a carrer in the tech industry. 

I am most interested in:
- Cybersecurity and networking (Protecting people's data and information while they communicate online and how those communications take place)
- AI and machine learning (How computers can adapt and learn similar to humans in order to complete a highly complicated task)
- Software engineering and System design (How computer programs can be created for a particular purpose to process large quanities of information and assist humans with tasks)

# My current projects

I am currently working on a neural network which will use Q learning to learn how to optimally play a racing game. This will be used to visually demonstrate to students how machine learning can be used and will strengthen my own knowledge of implementing neural networks in python. 

I am also in the process of designing a project which will use graph theory and algorithms to simulate a train network. This will be used to decide upon optimal train routes to be travelled on to reach the desination the quickest and will strengthen my understanding of graph theory and will be a fun challenge to implement in code.

Additionally, I have begun gradually working through the Project Euler website to tackle interesting puzzles with high mathematical content. You can view my code for each problem [here!](https://github.com/Memey21/Euler-project).

# Certifications

At college, I have recieved a gold Bebras award for scoring highly on their yearly computational thinking Bebras challenge which demonstrates my problem solving capabilities.

# Skills I have developed

Through my work in Maths and Computer Science I have developed strong problem solving skills and I am able to use logical thinking to develop strong solutions to issues which are presented to me.
I have collaborated with others in group projects to develop my team working skills and I am able to effectively communicate ideas and organise a team's resources.
I am a determined and hardworking student and I show dedication to constantly improve my understanding of my subjects.

# Projects I have completed

[Hotel Kashyyk](https://github.com/BHASVIC-OscarTurnbull24/Hotel-Kashyyk) is a hotel management application I developed in a group with functionality to book rooms, reserve dinner tables and check out with a final bill.

[The Euler Project](https://github.com/Memey21/Euler-project) I have worked on a variety of different Euler Project questions which have improved my mathematical ability to problem solve and also my efficiency at programming.

[Animalopoly](https://github.com/BHASVIC-OscarTurnbull24/Animalopoly)  I worked in a group and was tasked with creating a monopoly-like game in Java with abilities for mutliple players to roll dice to move around a board and as they go they can purchase different animals and upgrade them which grants them money if another player lands on the animals.
